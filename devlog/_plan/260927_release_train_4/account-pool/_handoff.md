# Account-pool lane handoff

## 2026-09-28 successor thread (01a0e37e-5770-7fd1-b4a0-43d3e34747f5)

The successor took over from thread 01a0e337-eb7e-7ff3-a507-5a360610e3e0 in the same worktree. Remote state was unchanged at pickup: `origin/dev` `24b2f39b77`, #6087 head `480083070a`, all candidate PRs and nine issues open.

wp0 closed with a second audit round run on gpt-6-sol (see "Audit round 2 and repair" in [000_plan.md](000_plan.md)). The plan now ships two PRs: PR-1 for the #6087 pause carry (gate owned by wp1) and PR-2 for the bounded Antigravity 401/validated-403 slice (gate owned by wp3, cut from `dev` after PR-1 merges). A same-commit verification checkout exists at `/private/tmp/t4-account-pool-verify` with root and `gui` dependencies installed.

Next: wp1 on branch `codex/t4-account-pool-pause`.

## 2026-09-28 original thread (stopped)

Stopped on coordinator instruction on branch `codex/t4-account-pool-roadmap` at base `24b2f39b77`. No PR was opened and no GitHub comment was posted. Round 1 audit returned FAIL with five blockers; the amended plan was not re-audited before the stop. Baseline `bun run typecheck` and `bun run privacy:scan` passed after `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. No proxy was started and no real home files were touched.
